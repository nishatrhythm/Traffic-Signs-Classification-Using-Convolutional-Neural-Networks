## Introduction

Traffic sign recognition is crucial for the development of self-driving cars and other intelligent road systems. This project employs a CNN model to classify images of traffic signs into 43 distinct classes. Using image processing and data augmentation techniques, the model achieves robust performance, making it suitable for real-world applications.

## Dataset

The project uses the [German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=news) dataset, which contains over 35,000 images of 43 different traffic sign classes. The images are of varying sizes, lighting conditions, and angles, making this a challenging classification task.

### Data Split
- **Training Set**: 80% of the dataset
- **Validation Set**: 20% of the training data
- **Test Set**: 20% of the total dataset

## Model Architecture

The CNN model has been built using the Keras framework. The architecture includes:

- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the input images.
- **MaxPooling Layers**: Reduce the spatial dimensions of feature maps.
- **Dropout Layers**: Prevent overfitting by dropping nodes during training.
- **Dense Layers**: Perform final classification using a softmax activation function.

### Model Summary

The network includes:
- Two sets of Convolutional and MaxPooling layers.
- Dropout layers with a 50% drop rate to enhance generalization.
- A fully connected layer followed by a softmax output layer.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following packages installed:
- Python (>= 3.6)
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishatrhythm/Traffic-Signs-Classification-Using-Convolution-Neural-Networks.git
   cd Traffic-Signs-Classification-Using-Convolution-Neural-Networks
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Training and Evaluation

### Preprocessing

Images are preprocessed using OpenCV:

- **Grayscale Conversion**: Simplifies the image by reducing color channels.
- **Histogram Equalization**: Normalizes the lighting conditions.
- **Normalization**: Scales pixel values to the [0, 1] range.

### Data Augmentation

To improve model generalization, data augmentation techniques such as width/height shifts, zoom, shear, and rotations are applied.

### Training

To train the model, run:
```bash
python TrafficSigns_main.py
```
The model is trained using the Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function. The training history, including accuracy and loss curves, is plotted for analysis.

### Evaluation
The model is evaluated on the test set to measure performance. The final model is saved as `model_trained.p` for later use.

## Live Testing

You can test the model in real-time using a webcam. The model detects and classifies traffic signs with a specified probability threshold.

### Running the Live Test

```bash
python TrafficSigns_test.py
```
- Press `q` to quit the live demo.
- The `TrafficSigns_test.py` script captures images from the webcam, preprocesses them, and classifies the traffic signs using the trained model.

### Live Test Results

## Web App

A web application has been developed alongside the Python implementation to classify traffic signs directly from a browser. Built using Python, Flask, and Tailwind CSS, this app offers a simple and efficient way to upload images and receive classification results in real-time using the trained CNN model.
